0x0F. C - Function pointers

A function pointer in C is a variable that stores the address of a function. This means that you can use a function pointer to call a function without knowing its name, or to call a function from within another function.

Function pointers can be used to do a variety of things in C. For example, you can use them to:

1.Call a function from within another function.
2.Pass a function as an argument to another function.
3.Return a function from a function.
4.Create a callback function.

Function pointers are a powerful tool that can be used to make your C code more flexible and efficient.
