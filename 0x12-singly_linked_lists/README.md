A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. Each node contains two parts: data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The first node in the sequence is called the head node, and the last node is called the tail node.

A singly linked list is a linear data structure, which means that the nodes are arranged in a single, continuous sequence. This makes it easy to traverse the list, starting from the head node and moving to the next node until the tail node is reached.

Singly linked lists are dynamic data structures, which means that their size can change during runtime. This makes them a good choice for applications where the number of elements in the list is not known in advance.

The following are the key concepts of singly linked lists:

Nodes: A node is a unit of data in a linked list. It consists of two parts: data and a pointer to the next node.
Head node: The head node is the first node in the linked list. It points to the rest of the nodes in the list.
Tail node: The tail node is the last node in the linked list. It does not point to any other node.
Pointer: A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable. In a linked list, a pointer is used to store the address of the next node.

Singly linked lists are a versatile data structure that can be used for a variety of tasks, such as:

Storing a list of data
Traversing a list of data
Searching a list of data
Sorting a list of data
Deleting a node from a list
Inserting a node into a list
