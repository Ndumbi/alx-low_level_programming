0x13. C - More singly linked lists

A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which each element (called a node) is connected to the next element by a pointer. The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node is called the tail. The tail node's next pointer is typically set to NULL.

some of the basic operations that can be performed on singly linked lists:

Insertion
Deletion
Traversal
Searching
Merging
Sorting
Singly linked lists are a simple and efficient data structure that can be used to store a variety of data. They are often used in applications where the data is not frequently accessed, such as in storing a list of files or a list of employees.
