0x14-bit manipulation
This directory provides simple examples and explanations for performing bit manipulation in the C programming language. Bit manipulation is a technique that allows you to work with individual bits within a byte (8 bits) or larger data types. This can be useful for tasks such as setting specific flags, optimizing memory usage, or performing low-level operations.
