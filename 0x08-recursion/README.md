0x08. C - Recursion
Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself. This can be used to solve problems that would be difficult or impossible to solve without recursion.
In C, a function can call itself, creating a loop-like structure. It is a powerful approach for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems.
Recursion is a powerful tool in C programming, allowing elegant solutions to complex problems. By understanding its principles and following best practices, you can harness its potential to create efficient and reliable code.
