0x0D. C - Preprocessor

The preprocessor is a program that is used to process C source code before it is compiled. The preprocessor performs a number of tasks, including:

* Removing comments
* Expanding macros
* Including header files
* Performing conditional compilation

The preprocessor is not a compiler. It does not generate machine code. Instead, it generates a preprocessed source code file that is then passed to the compiler.

The preprocessor is a powerful tool that can be used to simplify and improve C code. It can be used to define macros, include header files, and perform conditional compilation.

Here are some examples of how the preprocessor can be used:

* The preprocessor can be used to define macros. Macros are abbreviations for commonly used expressions. For example, the following macro defines a macro called `MAX` that returns the maximum of two values:

```c
#define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
```

* The preprocessor can be used to include header files. Header files contain declarations for functions, variables, and macros. For example, the following line includes the header file `stdio.h`, which contains declarations for the `printf()` and `scanf()` functions:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

* The preprocessor can be used to perform conditional compilation. Conditional compilation allows the programmer to conditionally include or exclude parts of the source code. For example, the following code uses conditional compilation to include the `DEBUG` macro only if the `DEBUG` flag is defined:

```c
#ifdef DEBUG
#include "debug.h"
#endif
```
