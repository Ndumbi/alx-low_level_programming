C - Variadic functions

In programming, a function is like a recipe for the computer. A variadic function is a special type of function that can take a variable number of arguments (inputs) instead of a fixed number. It's like having a recipe that can work with different numbers of ingredients.

Just like you can add extra toppings to your dish, you can provide extra pieces of information to a variadic function. The function is designed to handle these extra inputs, even though it doesn't know exactly how many you'll provide.

In programming, variadic functions are used when you want to create a flexible function that can do something with any number of values you give it. It's a way to make your code more versatile, just like being able to customize a recipe by adding various toppings to your dish.
