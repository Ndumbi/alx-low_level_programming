0x0E. C - Structures, typedef


Structures and typedef are both preprocessor keywords in C that can be used to improve the readability and maintainability of code.

Structures are used to group related data together into a single unit. This can be useful for representing complex data, such as a person's name, address, and phone number.

typedef is used to create an alias for a data type. This can be useful for giving a more descriptive name to a data type, or for making code more readable.
Structures can be used to represent complex data, such as a geometric shape, a mathematical function, or a computer game object.
typedef can be used to give more descriptive names to data types, such as PixelColor for a struct that represents a pixel color, or Coordinate for a struct that represents a two-dimensional coordinate.
typedef can be used to make code more readable, such as by defining a typedef for a pointer to a function, such as void (*FunctionType)(void).
Structures and typedef are powerful tools that can be used to improve the readability and maintainability of C code. They can be used to represent complex data, give more descriptive names to data types, and make code more readable.
